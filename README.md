I am Saad Mohiuddin, a sophomore at The University of Hong Kong intending to major in maths and physics. I am really interested in computer science both as a field of mathematics as well as a tool for achieving wonders in pretty much every field of study. i am particularly interested in the impact Computer Science creates in physics research. That is one of the primary reasons why I want to learn programming.
